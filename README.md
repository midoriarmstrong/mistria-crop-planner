# Fields of Mistria Crop Planner

**([Live Version](https://midoriarmstrong.github.io/mistria-crop-planner/))**

## About

The Fields of Mistria crop planner is a tool for planning and optimizing your crops in [Fields of Mistria](https://www.fieldsofmistria.com/). Its overall UI design was based off of exnil's [Stardew Valley Crop Planner](https://exnil.github.io/crop_planner/), but the code itself was rewritten from scratch in React.

## Current planned functionality

- Some kind of recipe UI (to see the daily profit when ex. tea is processed into Rose Tea.)

## Development

### Prerequisites

This website was developed on [Node 22](https://nodejs.org/en/download), though it may still run on older versions of Node.

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/midoriarmstrong/mistria-crop-planner.git
cd mistria-crop-planner
npm install
npm start
```

The site should be up at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Adding a new crop

To update the list of icons in [src/constants/icon-constants.ts](/src/constants/icon-constants.ts):

1. Add the crop sprite to `src/assets/crops/` and the seed sprite to `src/assets/seeds/`
2. Add the crop details to the `CROPS` const in [src/constants/table/Crops.ts](/src/constants/table/Crops.ts).
3. Run `npm run generate:constants:icons`.
